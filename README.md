# Purpose

Quick, we don't want her to know that we saved this pic, what shall we do? SnapchatHax to the rescue! The purpose of this project is twofold:

* to provide an easy-to-use Objective-C platform to interface with the Snapchat backend.
* to provide users with an easy-to-use iOS application for the purpose of bypassing Snapchat's inherent limitations.
